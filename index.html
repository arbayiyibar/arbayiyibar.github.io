              until November 19, when the coffin in which his body rested,
              covered by a Turkish flag, was taken in procession to Sarayburnu.
              After it was placed onto the battleship Yavuz, it was transported
              to Izmit and later placed on a specially designated train which
              travelled at a slow speed throughout the country to enable
              mourners to pay tribute to their leader. Once the coffin arrived
              in Ankara on November 20, an official funeral was held on November
              21. Dignitaries from many countries attended Ataturk’s state
              funeral. The coffin was moved in a solemn procession by gun
              carriage from the Grand National Assembly to the Ethnographic
              Museum, which had been selected as a temporary resting place until
              a mausoleum for Atatürk could be constructed.
